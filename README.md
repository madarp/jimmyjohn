An experiment in Machine Learning object recognition, to spot a Jimmy John's delivery vehicle on a IP surveillance camera.

# The Dataset
This is what a Jimmy Johns delivery looks like to the camera.

Images were acquired from a surveillance video recorder.  Annotations (labels, bounding boxes) were generated manually using the labelimg utility, which creates a PASCAL-VOC XML file for each image.
