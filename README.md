An experiment in Machine Learning object recognition, to spot a Jimmy John's delivery vehicle on a IP surveillance camera.

# The Dataset
This is what a Jimmy Johns delivery looks like to the camera.

Images were acquired from a surveillance video recorder.  Annotations (labels, bounding boxes) were generated manually using the [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) utility, which creates a [PASCAL-VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) formatted XML file for each image.
